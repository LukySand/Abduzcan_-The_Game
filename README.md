# Abduzcan_-The_Game

This was the final proyect for the subject "Intro to Programing" of our first year studing Software Engineering. It was made completely in processing 2.2.1, the code was built 100% from scratch (Exept some of the png's). We wanted to add and update a few things but sandly de due date came fast and we had to wrap a few things up, if you wanna have a few minuets of fun feel free to play!
